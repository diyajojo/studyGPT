    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of an application program in a database?",
      "answer": "An application program accesses the database by sending queries or requests for data to the DBMS. A query typically causes some data to be retrieved; a transaction may cause some data to be read and some data to be written into the database."

    },
    {
      "question": "What is semi-structured data?",
      "answer": "Semi-structured data does not fit into a strict relational structure but still has some organizational properties, such as tags or markers, that make it easier to analyze than unstructured data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one of the advantages of a DBMS?",
      "answer": "One of the advantages of a DBMS is controlling redundancy. Redundancy in storing the same data multiple times leads to several problems such as duplication of effort and wasted storage space. A DBMS allows for data normalization, ensuring consistency and saving storage space."
