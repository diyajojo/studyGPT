      {
        "question": "What is the significance of concurrency control and recovery in transaction processing?",
        "answer": "Concurrency control and recovery are critical in transaction processing as they ensure the accuracy and reliability of data. Concurrency control prevents conflicts when multiple transactions are executed simultaneously by ensuring data consistency. Recovery, on the other hand, ensures that the database can return to a consistent state after any failure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are transaction states and system logs?",
        "answer": "Transaction states are the various stages a transaction goes through from initiation to completion or termination. They include active, partially committed, committed, failed, and aborted. System logs are files that record all actions in a database that alter data, aiding in recovery when a failure occurs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are desirable properties of transactions?",
        "answer": "Desirable properties of transactions include Atomicity (all or nothing), Consistency (ensures system moves from one consistent state to another), Isolation (each transaction should execute independently), and Durability (once committed, changes are permanent)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between serial schedules and concurrent schedules?",
        "answer": "Serial schedules involve executing one transaction after another, ensuring data consistency but often leading to underutilization of system resources. Concurrent schedules allow multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously, improving system utilization but requiring careful management to avoid data inconsistency."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is conflict equivalence and conflict serializability?",
        "answer": "Conflict equivalence refers to two schedules being conflict equivalent if they have the same set of transactions and the order of conflicting operations is the same. Conflict serializability is a method to check if a concurrent schedule is equivalent to a serial one, ensuring that concurrent execution of transactions does not lead to inconsistency."
