      },
      {
        "question": "What is a race condition in the context of process synchronization?",
        "answer": "A race condition occurs in process synchronization when the output of a process depends on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes problematic when multiple processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the different types of scheduling algorithms and how do they work?",
        "answer": "There are several types of scheduling algorithms, including First Come First Served (processes are scheduled in the order of their arrival), Shortest Job First (the process with the smallest execution time is selected for execution next), Priority Scheduling (processes are scheduled based on priority), and Round Robin Scheduling (each process is given a fixed time slot in a cyclic way). The working of each algorithm depends on its principle of operation."
