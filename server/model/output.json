    "mod2": [
      {
        "question": "What is the relational model in databases?",
        "answer": "The relational model was first introduced by Ted Codd in 1970. It represents a database as a collection of relations. A relation is a table with values, and each row in the table is a collection of related data values representing a real-world entity. A row in a relational table is called a tuple, a column header is an attribute, and the table itself is a relation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is relational algebra in the context of databases?",
        "answer": "Relational algebra is a set of operations used to manipulate or query data within a relational database. It includes operations like select, project, Cartesian product, and join, including equi-join and natural join."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the ER diagram represent in the context of databases?",
        "answer": "An ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram represents the structure of a database. It includes entity sets, attributes, relationships, constraints, cardinality, participation, weak entities, and relationships of degree 3. The ER diagram is then synthesized into a relational schema."

    ],
    "mod4": [
      {
        "question": "What are the different anomalies in designing a database?",
        "answer": "Anomalies in database design are issues that arise when a database is not properly normalized. These include update anomalies, where changes in data can lead to inconsistencies; insertion anomalies, where certain data cannot be inserted without the presence of other data; and deletion anomalies, where the deletion of certain data can result in unintended loss of other data."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the concept of normalization in database design?",
        "answer": "Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics like insertion, update and deletion anomalies. It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form by removing duplicated data from the relation tables."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the four normal forms in database design?",
        "answer": "The four normal forms in database design are First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), and Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF). Each form has a specific set of rules and requirements that must be met for a database to be considered in that form."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is lossless join and dependency preserving decomposition?",
        "answer": "Lossless join property ensures that the spurious tuples are not generated when relations are joined back. Dependency preserving property ensures that all functional dependencies are preserved while decomposing. These properties are crucial to maintain data integrity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the purpose of algorithms for checking Lossless Join and Dependency preserving properties?",
        "answer": "The algorithms for checking Lossless Join and Dependency Preserving properties are used to verify the correctness of the decomposition. They are used to ensure that the decomposition of a database schema, into multiple schemas, does not result in the loss of information, and that it preserves all functional dependencies of the original schema."

      {
        "question": "What is the significance of concurrency control in transaction processing?",
        "answer": "Concurrency control in transaction processing is significant as it ensures that database transactions are performed concurrently without violating the data integrity. It prevents conflicts which could arise when multiple transactions are executed simultaneously, and ensures the consistency and isolation of each transaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the desirable properties of transactions?",
        "answer": "The desirable properties of transactions, often referred to as ACID properties, include Atomicity (the whole transaction is processed or none of it is), Consistency (ensuring data remains consistent before and after the transaction), Isolation (each transaction is executed in isolation from other transactions), and Durability (the results of a transaction are permanent, even in cases of system failure)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does two-phase locking contribute to transaction processing?",
        "answer": "Two-phase locking (2PL) is a concurrency control method that ensures serializability in transaction processing. It has two phases, the expanding phase where locks are acquired and no locks are released, and the shrinking phase where locks are released and no new locks are acquired. This protocol prevents conflicts and ensures that transactions do not overlap, maintaining data integrity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the purpose of log-based recovery in transaction processing?",
        "answer": "Log-based recovery in transaction processing is a technique to bring the database back to a consistent state after a failure or system crash. It involves keeping a log of all changes made to the database during the transaction execution. If a failure occurs, the system can use the log to undo the changes from incomplete transactions and restore the database to its previous consistent state."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main characteristics of NoSQL databases such as Key-value DB and Document DB?",
        "answer": "NoSQL databases such as Key-value DB and Document DB are designed to handle large data sets efficiently. Key-value DB, like Redis, stores data as a collection of key-value pairs, making it highly efficient for lookup operations. Document DB, like MongoDB, stores data in a semi-structured document format, usually JSON, which allows for greater flexibility in data modeling and handling complex hierarchical data structures."

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data?",
        "answer": "Structured data is highly organized and easily searchable in relational databases. Semi-structured data, while not as organized as structured data, contains tags or other markers to enforce hierarchy and order. Unstructured data lacks a predefined model or organization, making it more complex to analyze and process."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the three-schema-architecture in DBMS?",
        "answer": "The three-schema-architecture in DBMS is a database architecture that separates the conceptual, external, and internal schemas. The conceptual schema defines all database entities, relationships, and constraints. The external schema defines how users view the data. The internal schema defines physical storage methods and structures."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are weak entities in the context of an ER model?",
        "answer": "Weak entities in the ER model are entities that cannot be uniquely identified by their attributes alone. They depend on some other entity, known as the owner or parent entity. The relationship between a weak entity and its owner entity is called an identifying relationship."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the role of cardinality and participation in the context of an ER model?",
        "answer": "In the context of an ER model, cardinality defines the numerical attributes of the relationship between two entities, while participation determines if all or only some instances of an entity are involved in the relationship. Both concepts help to more accurately model real-world relationships in the database."
