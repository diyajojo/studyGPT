        "question": "What is the principle behind binary number multiplication algorithm?",
        "answer": "The principle behind binary multiplication algorithm is similar to the traditional multiplication method. Each digit in the multiplier is multiplied with the multiplicand, shifted according to its position, and then all results are added to get the final result."
