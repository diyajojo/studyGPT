        "question": "What is the Relational Model in database systems?",
        "answer": "The relational model is a type of database model that was first introduced by Ted Codd in 1970. It represents a database as a collection of relations, where each relation is a table with rows and columns. Each row, also known as a tuple, represents a real-world entity and its related values. The column header is known as an attribute, and the table as a whole is called a relation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Relational Algebra and what are its operations?",
        "answer": "Relational Algebra is a procedural query language that operates on a relational data model. It involves operations that are applied to database structures, specifically relations. The primary operations in relational algebra are select, project, cartesian product, and join (including Equi-join and natural join)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the role of Integrity Constraints in the structure of relational databases?",
        "answer": "Integrity Constraints are rules that are applied to maintain the quality and accuracy of the data in a relational database. They ensure the integrity and consistency of the data by preventing the entry of invalid information into the tables. They are an important part of the structure of relational databases."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the purpose of Data Definition Language (DDL) in SQL?",
        "answer": "Data Definition Language (DDL) in SQL is used for defining and managing all the objects in an SQL database. It includes commands such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE, which are used to create, modify, or delete database structures but not data."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process of synthesizing an ER diagram to a relational schema?",
        "answer": "Synthesizing an ER diagram to a relational schema involves translating the entities, attributes, and relationships represented in the ER diagram into tables (or relations) of a relational schema. Each entity type becomes a table, individual entities become rows (or tuples), and attributes become columns in the table."

      {
        "question": "What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?",
        "answer": "A Database Management System (DBMS) is a system designed to manage databases. It allows users to create, retrieve, update and manage data in a database."

      },
      {
        "question": "What is an Entity Relationship (ER) model in DBMS?",
        "answer": "The Entity Relationship (ER) model in DBMS is a high-level data model that defines data elements and their relationship for a specified software system. It is used to design and represent the database structure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the purpose of Data Definition Language (DDL) in DBMS?",
        "answer": "Data Definition Language (DDL) in DBMS is used to define and manage all the objects in an database, such as creating, altering, and deleting tables, schemas, or databases."

      {
        "question": "What is the significance of concurrency control in transaction processing?",
        "answer": "Concurrency control is significant in transaction processing as it ensures the correctness of a database in a multi-user and multitasking environment. It prevents conflicts caused by simultaneous operations and maintains data consistency."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the desirable properties of transactions?",
        "answer": "The desirable properties of transactions are Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID). Atomicity ensures all operations in a transaction are completed successfully or none at all. Consistency ensures the database remains consistent before and after the transaction. Isolation ensures each transaction is executed in isolation from other transactions. Durability ensures the effect of committed transactions are permanent."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is conflict serializability in the context of transaction processing?",
        "answer": "Conflict serializability is a concept in concurrent execution of transactions where the concurrent execution is equivalent to some serial execution of the transactions. It ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions preserves the consistency of the database."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the role of log-based recovery in transaction processing?",
        "answer": "Log-based recovery is used in transaction processing to recover the database from failures. It keeps a log of each transaction that modifies the database. In case of a system failure, the logs are used to roll back the transactions and restore the database to a consistent state."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main characteristics of Key-value and Document DB?",
        "answer": "Key-value DB, like Redis, stores data as a collection of key-value pairs where the key is unique. It's simple and efficient for read/write operations. Document DB, like MongoDB, stores data in document-like structures that can contain various data types. It's flexible and suitable for storing semi-structured data."

      {
        "question": "What is the idea of normalization in database design?",

        "question": "What are Armstrong’s Axioms in the context of Functional Dependencies?",
        "answer": "Armstrong's Axioms are a set of rules about functional dependencies which are used to infer all the functional dependencies on a relational database. They include reflexivity, augmentation, transitivity, decomposition, union, and pseudo transitivity. They are used for testing the logical implication of functional dependencies."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do the First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF) entail in database normalization?",
        "answer": "1NF requires that each column should have atomic (indivisible) values and each row must be unique. 2NF requires that every non-prime attribute of the table is functionally dependent on the primary key. 3NF requires that all the attributes in a table are functionally dependent only on the primary key and not on any other non-prime attribute."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a lossless join and dependency preserving decomposition in the context of database normalization?",
        "answer": "Lossless join ensures that the spurious tuple generation does not occur with respect to relation schemas after decomposition. Dependency preserving decomposition ensures that each functional dependency X -> Y can be validated by using only the tuples in one relation of the decomposition."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the guidelines for creating a good relational schema design?",
        "answer": "Four important guidelines include ensuring the semantics of the attributes are clear in the schema, reducing redundant information in tuples, reducing NULL values in tuples, and disallowing the possibility of generating spurious tuples."
