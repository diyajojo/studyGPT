    ],
    "mod3": [
      {
        "question": "What is process synchronization and why is it important?",

      {
        "question": "Can you explain the concept of memory management in computer science and engineering?",
        "answer": "Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory. It keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes and decides which process will get memory at what time. Concepts involved include the concept of address spaces, swapping, contiguous memory allocation, fixed and variable partitions, segmentation, paging, virtual memory, demand paging, and page replacement algorithms."
